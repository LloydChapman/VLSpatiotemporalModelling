19 para run
started friday 10 may 16:14
completion of <19 paras by sat 12:26
ran post processing to get csvs though needed to define para again in command window

6/19 incomplete paras 2,7,12,14,17,18. why? All hadn't even reached 1000 iteration printout when I checked on mon 10 may 11:08.
Hoping re-running the command will fix it? Doesn't appear to have.

On VLStmMCMC2010FastLklhdMgrtn.m I tried to show all iter printouts at line 2082 but didnt reach here
